<h3> Of course I want to be like them. Theyâ€™re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever. And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.</h3>

<h3>ðŸ‘‘ <u> Chapter 1 </u> ðŸ‘‘ </h3>

<p>Jude Duarte (the narrator) recalls the night her world shattered. A strangerâ€”Madoc, a faerie generalâ€”arrives at her familyâ€™s home, murders her mortal parents, and takes her and her sisters, Vivienne (Vivi) and Taryn, to live in Faerie. Vivi is Madocâ€™s biological daughter, but Jude and Taryn are mortals. From this moment, Jude is thrust into a land where mortals are vulnerable and despised.</p>

<p>Growing up in Elfhame, Jude struggles with being mortal among powerful, magical faeries. She feels out of place but also begins to crave belonging and respect.
