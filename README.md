I enjoyed Flexbox and Grid since they make working with layout so much more easy to use and flexible. Either of these will definitely streamline my workflow by reducing the amount of manual positioning and media queries I need to write. I think both Grid and Flexbox have good properties depending on what you are using it for. I prefer Grid so far because it gives me a clear visual structure and more control over page layout, but I appreciate how Flexbox does so well with simpler, one-dimensional alignments. I do think with this project I will be leaning more towards using Flexbox.
